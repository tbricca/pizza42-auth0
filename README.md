# Auth0 JavaScript Build out For Pizza 42 

#Calling an API

This sample demonstrates how to make secure calls to an API after authenticating a user with Auth0. The calls to the API are made with the user's `access_token` and at the moment utilizes a fake online REST API for testing from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/. After a user is logged in and clicks order pizza they will recieve an alert notifying them that the request is recieved and a JSON object will be sent back. 

## Getting Started

# To Run it Locally

npm install
npm start

The application will be served at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Set the Client ID, Domain, and API URL

If you download the sample from the quickstart page, it will come pre-populated with the **client ID** and **domain** for your application. If you clone the repo directly from Github, rename the `auth0-variables.js.example` file to `auth0-variables.js` and provide the **client ID** and **domain** there.

You should also provide the identifier for the API you create in the Auth0 dashboard as your `apiUrl`. At the same time you should define the expected value(`'read:messages'`) for the [required scope argument](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-javascript-samples/blob/master/03-Calling-an-API/app.js#L17) in creating `auth0.WebAuth`.

## Set Up the `.env` File

In addition to the above-mentioned `auth0-variables.js` file, a `.env` file is provided at the root of the application. This file provides your application's credentials to the small Node server located in `server.js`.

This file has two values, `AUTH0_AUDIENCE` and `AUTH0_DOMAIN`. If you download this sample from the quickstart page, the value for `AUTH0_DOMAIN` will be populated automatically, but you will still need to populate `AUTH0_AUDIENCE` manually. The value for `AUTH0_AUDIENCE` is the identifier used for an API that you create in the Auth0 dashboard.



## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, among others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
