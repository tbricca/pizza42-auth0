![Homepage](images/pizza42.png)
#Calling an API

This sample demonstrates how to make secure calls to an API after authenticating a user with Auth0. The calls to the API are made with the user's `access_token` and at the moment utilizes a fake online REST API for testing from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/. After a user is logged in and clicks order pizza they will recieve an alert notifying them that the request is recieved and a JSON object will be sent back.
